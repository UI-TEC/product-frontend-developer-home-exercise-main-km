## Introduction

Thank you for taking part in our home exercise. We've provided a template solution to minimize setup 
and allow you to focus on the core task.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository and open the solution in your development environment of choice
2. Install the dependencies listed in `package.json`
3. Run the project using the `start` script in the `package.json`
4. Verify that the project is running as expected using the instructions in `src/scripts/index.ts`

The project includes:

- configuration files for dependencies and the development environment in the project root
- a `public/` directory that contains the files distributed by the development server
- a `src/` directory that contains the source files for filetypes that need to be processed before they can be 
  distributed in the `public/` directory
- a PDF of the design specification for this task
